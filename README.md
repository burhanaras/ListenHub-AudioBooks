# ListenHub-iOS
Listen to books anywhere


Developed by [Burhan ARAS] with all the love on planet.

**ListenHub :** An audio book app to listen to books everywhere.

## Architecture

We have developed this application using **MVVM-C Architecture** . We haved used the **Swift** programming language along industry-proven tools and libraries.

The main players in the MVVM-C pattern are:
  - **The View**â€Šâ€”â€Šthat informs the ViewModel about the userâ€™s actions
  - **The ViewModel**â€Šâ€”â€Šexposes streams of data relevant to the View
  - **The DataModel**â€Šâ€”â€Šabstracts the data source. The ViewModel works with the DataModel to get and save the data.
  - **The Coordinator** - where dependency injection happens.


In this MVVM-C architecture SwiftUI depend only on a view model (which is an Observable Object). The repository is the only class that depends on multiple other classes; in this project, the repository depends on a persistent data model and a remote backend data source.

Repository is the single source of truth for all the app data and has a clean API for UI to communicate with.

Repository fetches data from network then it saves into local database and also notifies UI View classes.

## Used technologies and libraries

We have used popular, industry-proven tools and libraries :

* **SwiftUI** SwiftUI is a modern way to declare user interfaces for any Apple platform. 
* **Combine** provides a declarative Swift API for processing values over time.
* **Realm** To save data to local db
* **KingFisher** To fetch images from network
* **XCTest** To write automated tests
* **SwiftLint** To see warnings in our code

## Package Structure

* **UI** Contains UI related classes which are SwiftUI view and ObservableObjects.
* **Repository** Single source of truth for all the app data. Contains DAO, entity classes, Realm DB implementation and everything else related to database
* **Player** AVQueuePlayer and player model objects to play audio.
* **Network** Contains Combine implementation and UrlSession service api interface and data transfer objects
* **Views** Single source of truth for all the app data
* **Coordinator** Contains a WorkManager worker to run daily and keep local db up to date
* **Extension** Swift extensions for every kind of util functionalities.
* **App** SwiftUI App class which is main entry point of the app.


## TO-DO List

* Real network implementation
* Local DB implementation
* Apple Watch client
* iPadOS client
* CarPlay client
* AppleTV client
* Siri support
* Widget support
